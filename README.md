# Chess Game

## Colby Leavitt & Gabriel Romanini de Barros
### COP 3252, Fall 2023, Bob Myers - Florida State University

In lieu of personal collaboration logs, graders can check our commits at https://github.com/GabrielBarros36/JavaFinalProject .

### Extra features

To the right of the chess board you'll find a drop-down menu labeled "Game : n" where 1 <= n <= 5. 
Games save automatically, and you can switch between as many as 5 games without losing your progress.

### Notes on gameplay
Moving pieces is not always seamless - you might have to click the piece you're trying to move and then the square you want to move it to.
Every legal move is supported by our program, so if it seems as though you can't make a move you should be allowed to make you might need to follow the advice laid out previously.
